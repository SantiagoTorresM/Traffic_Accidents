Key Factors Influencing Traffic Accidents


This dataset captures key factors influencing traffic accidents in both urban and rural areas. It provides detailed information about environmental, infrastructural, and behavioral variables that are crucial for understanding the dynamics of road safety. With a focus on 8,756 observations, it covers a wide range of scenarios, from dense urban intersections to quieter rural roads.

Key Features
Accidents: The number of recorded traffic accidents, ranging from minor incidents to significant collisions.
Traffic Fine Amount: Represents the average amount of traffic fines (in thousands of USD) in the observed area, linked to enforcement efforts and driver behavior.
Traffic Density: A score indicating the volume of vehicles in the area, on a scale from 0 (low) to 10 (high).
Traffic Lights: Proportion of traffic lights in the area, highlighting intersections with varying levels of control.
Pavement Quality: A rating (0-5) of road conditions, with higher values indicating better infrastructure.
Urban or Rural Classification: Binary indicator showing whether the area is urban (1) or rural (0).
Average Speed: The typical speed of vehicles in kilometers per hour, representing driving conditions.
Rain Intensity: A scale from 0 (no rain) to 3 (heavy rain), emphasizing the role of weather in accidents.
Vehicle Count: Estimated number of vehicles (in thousands) present in the area during the observation.
Time of Day: A 24-hour format (0 to 24) to capture temporal patterns in accident occurrences.
Purpose
This dataset is designed for:

Traffic safety analysis.
Urban planning and infrastructure improvement.
Predictive modeling to identify high-risk conditions and prevent accidents.
Policy-making to enhance road safety and reduce traffic-related incidents.
Applications
Researchers, urban planners, and policymakers can use this dataset to:

Analyze Trends: Identify temporal and spatial patterns of accidents.
Model Risks: Develop machine learning models to predict accident hotspots.
Improve Infrastructure: Prioritize areas needing better pavement quality or traffic control.
Enhance Awareness: Understand the role of weather, speed, and traffic density in accident rates.
This dataset provides a rich and comprehensive foundation for data-driven decision-making in traffic safety management.
